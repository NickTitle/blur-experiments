blur-experiments
================

this simple test shows a raster blur (very fast) and a CGImage blur on toggle switches

- raster blur's quality can be edited by changing the rasterization scale (line 60 of the main view controller)
- cg blur isn't currently drawing over the image due to some hiccup in my code, but the speed of the operation is slow to the point that i wouldn't use this anyway
